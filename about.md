I received my BS in Biology from the University of Puget Sound in 2009, and
my PhD in Biology 
([Biology & Society: History & Philosophy of Science](https://cbs.asu.edu/home)) from 
Arizona State University in 2015. In the archives, I study the epistemic and 
methodological transformations that gave rise to the fields of evolutionary ecology and
ecological genetics in the mid-20th century. At the keyboard, I 
[develop](https://github.com/erickpeirson) software and web applications to support
computational analysis and data management for big-data projects in the sciences and
humanities.

Together with Julia Damerow and Manfred Laubichler, in 2012 I helped establish the 
[ASU Digital Innovation Group](http://devo-evo.lab.asu.edu/diging). The mission of the 
Digital Innovation Group is to develop new tools to support HPS researchers in processing
and analyzing their data, to contribute to the development of a computational research
system for history and philosophy of science, and to create new educational resources,
opportunities, and experiences for students in computer science and the history and 
philosophy of science.
